humanity had long since reached the stars — yet one small colony stood apart from the grand networks of trade and technology. It was called Erewhon, a distant world orbiting a dim red sun, where people lived not in chrome towers or AI cities, but in a quiet, self-sustaining settlement that resembled the simplicity of medieval times.

Erewhon was more than a colony; it was an experiment — a living island floating in the void. The settlers believed that true survival meant independence, that life should be bound to the land, even if that land was alien soil. Every tool, every meal, every breath of air came from the colony itself. Nothing was imported. Nothing was wasted.

The colony’s heart was divided into four great Houses:

The Oxygen Foundry, where huge bio-reactors fed on native moss and mineral water, exhaling pure, breathable air into the domes.

The Food Forge, where farmers and engineers worked side by side, blending ancient agriculture with slow-growing synthetic crops to feed the entire population.

The Material Works, responsible for mining and refining the planet’s soil into stone, metal, and ceramic — the bones of Erewhon.

The Artisan Hall, where basic products were crafted — tools, fabrics, and furniture — all made from local resources.


There was no money on Erewhon, only exchange. A loaf of bread might be worth a bar of steel; a day’s labor in the Foundry could earn a new pair of boots. Life was simple, yet deeply connected — everyone’s work had visible meaning.

Living in Erewhon was like living on a medieval island in space. The colonists built their homes with care, worshiped the twin moons as symbols of balance, and honored the cycles of harvest and renewal. When oxygen levels dipped, everyone worked together to restore them. When crops failed, every hand turned to help the farmers.

And yet, beneath its simplicity, Erewhon thrived. Its people had no wars, no pollution, and no excess. They had rediscovered something humanity had long forgotten: that survival is not about endless progress, but about harmony — with your world, your tools, and each other.

For in the vast emptiness of space, Erewhon had become what Earth once was — a living, breathing island of life.
